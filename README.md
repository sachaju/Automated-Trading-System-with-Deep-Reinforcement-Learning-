# 📈 Automated Trading System with Deep Reinforcement Learning  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements an **automated trading system** based on **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. The goal is to train **intelligent agents** capable of making profitable trading decisions in a simulated stock market environment.  

## 🎯 Features  
- **Simulated Trading Environment** 📊  
  - Market price modeling using real stock data  
  - Transaction costs included  
  - Reward system based on profitability  

- **Trained DRL Agents** 🤖  
  - **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization)  
  - **A2C** (Advantage Actor-Critic)  
  - **DDPG** (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)  
  - **SAC** (Soft Actor-Critic)  
  - **TD3** (Twin Delayed DDPG)  

- **Optimization & Robustness** ✅  
  - Implementation of an **ensemble agent**  
  - Comparison of model performance  

## 📊 Data Source  
We use **historical stock data** from **Yahoo Finance** 📈.  
The stocks analyzed in this project include:  
- **Apple (AAPL)** 🍏  
- **Amazon (AMZN)** 📦  
- **Microsoft (MSFT)** 💻  
- **Nvidia (NVDA)** 🎮  
- **Google (GOOGL)** 🔎  
- **Meta (META)** 📱  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** 🔥
